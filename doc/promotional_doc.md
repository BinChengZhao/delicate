The Delicate ** *** **  is officially available!

//TODO: there is features and pictures.


What's next#
At the beginning of this year, we announced our 2021 roadmap for Delicate. So far we implemented and released all the features that were announced to be available in February. So we will continue to follow this roadmap with the following objectives for next month:

Add the support of contact modification in Delicate. This will allow you to easily simulate, e.g., conveyor belts and one-way platforms.
Add the support for dominance in Delicate. This will make some object (typically the player modeled as a dynamic body) immune to forces applied by a selection of other objects.
These two features should actually be fairly quick to implement considering we already made some modifications to prepare for this future work. Therefore, we have a few more objective for next month:

Improve the user-guides of Delicate and make a user-guide for Delicate.
